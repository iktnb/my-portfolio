  paragraph: `I’m a frontend-leaning full-stack engineer with a strong product mindset.
I focus on clean architecture, automation, and building systems that scale without turning into technical debt.

I work across frontend, backend, and infrastructure — from UX-heavy flows to microservices, CI/CD, and cloud environments — helping products move smoothly from idea to production.

Outside of work, I explore system design, developer tooling, and build side projects to continuously improve how I engineer software.`,
